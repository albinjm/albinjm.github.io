     project_short: Image Segmentation
     project: ChromaCut is a cutting-edge toolkit for high-precision image segmentation, integrating advanced superpixel over-segmentation and graph-based techniques like the Boykov-Kolmogorov (Min-cut/Max-flow) algorithm. It processes images by first dividing them into superpixels for detailed analysis, then applies graph-based methods for accurate segmentation. Using CIDE2000 for color evaluation and foreground extraction, it enhances segmentation precision across diverse image types.

   - title: AutoDigit
     authors: 
     project_short: Image Denoising
     project: This project investigates the use of autoencoders for denoising images to improve handwritten digit recognition accuracy using the MNIST dataset. By introducing noise to the dataset and employing an autoencoder for image reconstruction, the study aims to enhance digit classification performance, demonstrating the practical applications and effectiveness of autoencoders in deep learning.
