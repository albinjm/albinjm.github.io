     project: NeuroCluster is an advanced image segmentation toolkit leveraging the Improved Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IIFCM) algorithm, specifically tailored for magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. This toolkit enables precise segmentation of MR images into distinct regions, enhancing the ability to identify and analyze various brain structures based on pixel intensity and color values. This can be useful for medical image analysis, such as identifying and measuring various brain structures, detecting tumors, lesions, or abnormalities, and studying the functional activity of the brain.
