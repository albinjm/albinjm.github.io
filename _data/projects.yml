     project_short: Image Segmentation
     project: ChromaCut is an interactive cutting-edge toolkit engineered for high-precision image segmentation. It incorporates state-of-the-art superpixel over-segmentation and graph-based segmentation techniques, including the renowned Boykov-Kolmogorov (Min-cut/Max-flow) algorithm for graph partitioning. This toolkit efficiently transforms input images into segmented outputs, starting with superpixel division for in-depth analysis and using graph-based algorithms for accurate segmentation. It utilizes CIDE2000 for color difference evaluation and foreground extraction, improving segmentation precision across various images.

     authors: 
     project_short: Image Denoising
     project: This project investigates the use of autoencoders for denoising images to improve handwritten digit recognition accuracy using the MNIST dataset. By introducing noise to the dataset and employing an autoencoder for image reconstruction, the study aims to enhance digit classification performance, demonstrating the practical applications and effectiveness of autoencoders in deep learning.
